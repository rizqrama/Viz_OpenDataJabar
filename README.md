# Viz_OpenDataJabar

**Welcome!**
This repositories will contain analysis and visualization of datasets obtained from [Open Data Jawa Barat](https://opendata.jabarprov.go.id/) platform. Mainly I will use R to visualize 'em. 

Open Data Jabar *(ODJ)* provides datasets collected from Jawa Barat Province's Regional Departments which can be accessed by public **freely!**

So, don't hesitate to explore, visualize, and even share your works using ODJ's datasets!

## about this repository
- *R* folder contains the code I wrote to produce visualization
- *Outfile* folder will show the exports (mostly in .png format) from the code I wrote before

Thank you!
*Regards*
